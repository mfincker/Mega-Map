    <h2>Black Lives Matter.</h2>
    <p>
      In sorrow and grief, anger and resistance, we mourn the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Michael Lorenzo Dean,
      Eric Reason, and every
      <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/29/865261916/a-decade-of-watching-black-people-die" target="_blank">life lost</a> to anti-Black
      violence. We stand with protestors and urgently declare: Black Lives Matter. Police brutality continues our country’s 400-year history
      of systemic racism. As Bay Area residents, we also acknowledge the sovereignty of the Ohlone tribe over the
      <a href="https://sogoreate-landtrust.org/contemporary-ohlone-history/" target="_blank">unceded land of the Bay Area</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We support the movement's demands for redistributing police budgets into new forms of public safety and security. Although our website
      does not specifically address systemic racism and inequity in this country, we built it to help people who are affected by these
      systems in very real, everyday ways to access essential resources during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. We recommit to our mission
      for every person to be guaranteed the right to safe housing, healthcare, just compensation, and a livable environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would like to share several resources our team has used to educate ourselves in allyship, and empower ourselves to action, during
      the weeks following George Floyd’s murder.
