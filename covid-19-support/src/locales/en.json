Mobilizing, the USDA allowed school districts to serve not only students in their district, but all children, at flexible service times and locations. These times and locations, however, changed frequently, and there was no single, reliable resource to help families across the Bay Area find out where meals were available. In response, our team of Stanford students and alumni used Google MyMaps to create and update a simple bilingual Bay Area school meals map that worked for phones.",

We partnered with {9} to update {10} for Stanford Hospital’s low-income patients, and distributed them to partners and counties. We began supplying our school meals data to No Kid Hungry’s {11}. The UC Nutrition Policy Institute and Nourish CA leveraged our data to advocate for expanding school meal funding, child nutrition benefits, and USDA school meal waivers. Since May, we have been advised by Anne Moertel, Public Information Officer for San Francisco Unified School District’s (SFUSD) Student Nutrition Services.",
